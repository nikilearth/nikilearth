### About Me

I am an **Electronics and Communication Engineering** student with a strong focus on the intersection of hardware and software. My academic journey is defined by a curiosity for how data moves from the physical world into digital systems.

Currently, I am deepening my understanding of **VLSI** and **Digital Design**, working on projects that bridge the gap between theoretical circuit analysis and practical implementation. I enjoy the challenge of optimizing logic for speed and area, and I am actively looking to collaborate on open-source hardware or embedded systems projects.

-  **Current Focus:** VLSI Design, Verilog, and Digital Logic.
-  **Learning:**  microcontroller architecture and FPGA prototyping.
-  **Open to:** Collaborations on digital design and embedded systems projects.
